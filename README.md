# 🧱 Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its ingredients using **deep learning regression and classification models**. It helps understand how material composition impacts concrete strength — a critical factor in civil and structural engineering.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using a dataset of concrete mixtures, this notebook explores how features such as cement, water, fly ash, coarse and fine aggregates influence the final compressive strength of the mixture.
